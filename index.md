# Tony's Learning Journal for Teaching Code
A dedicated journal for teaching programming and learning teaching fundamentals in general.

## Jan 15, 2022
- Currently marking a Git assignment for starting a markdown learning journal and was inspired to create a new journal dedicated to learning how to teach.
- Found some great videos on the subject:
    - [How learning journals can help students grow](https://bigthink.com/the-present/learning-journals/)
        - [And the breakdown!](/breakdowns/how-learning-journals-can-help-students-grow.md)
    - I found other videos on journaling about learning to code but they're lock up in the Shield Youtube plugin. I'll have to find them again. Very irritating.
