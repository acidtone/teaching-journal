### Keeping a learning journal (but for code)
- Currently marking a Git assignment for starting a markdown learning journal and was inspired to create a new journal dedicated to learning how to teach.
- Found some great videos on the subject:
    - [How learning journals can help students grow](https://bigthink.com/the-present/learning-journals/)
        - [And the breakdown!](/breakdowns/how-learning-journals-can-help-students-grow.md)
    - I found other videos on journaling about learning to code but they're lock up in the Shield Youtube plugin. I'll have to find them again. Very irritating.
    - Search terms I think I used in Youtube Search on the Shield:
        - "programming journal"
            - [5 Productivity Tools For Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8wQz6EVUzw) by Kalle Hallden
                - Git number 5!
                - TODO: breakdown
        - "markdown journal"
            - [Writing Notes in Markdown: A Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnCy7wJRgP0)
                - Great intro to markdown
                - TODO: prep, breakdown
                - are his slides written in markdown?
                - [@10:02](https://youtu.be/NnCy7wJRgP0?t=602): How does this benefit your note-taking
                    - He's assuming Obsidian. 
    - Couldn't find much so moved on to google search on Morty:
        - "keeping a programming journal"
            - [The power of keeping a coding journal](http://thomasburette.com/blog/2014/06/25/the-power-of-keeping-a-coding-journal/)
                - from 2014 but it's still relevant
                - great visual hierarchy at the start but it breaks down as it continues.
                - TODO: breakdown, visual hierarchy example, prep?

### Dated journal entries
Quantifying some objectives and criteria for a Coding Journal
- accepted locations
    - As an entry in your dedicated `coding-journal` repo.
    - In the README of a remote repo (project, assignment, etc) under the heading "Code Journal"
- General content categories. An entry can contain a combination of the following.
    1. class notes
        - video timestamp markers for important information
        - instructor/classmate quotes
        - observations
        - helpful/useful links pasted in the Chat
        - questions for later
        - reminders for Lab Time
        - TODOs
    2. self-assessment
        - Bring your receipts: What metrics are you basing your performance on?
            - the search terms you're using
            - GitHub activity
            - number of labs completed in class
            - amount of time spent coding
            - number of pair-coding sessions attempted
        - What concrete and precise goals have you set for yourself?
            - "I want to set aside a half-hour every day, dedicated to coding"
            - "I want to get a great search result with phrase that's 3 words or less"
            - "I want to push a commit every day"
            - "I want to review the Prep before every class"
            - "I want to attempt one tutorial every Lab Time this week"
        - Are you meeting the expectations you've set for yourself?
        - What steps can you take to learn more effectively?
        - What topics covered in class has interested you the most?
        - What are today's wins?
    3. Lab/tutorial/exercise attempts
        - What's the objective?
        - Does anything need to be planned out?
        - Numbered steps you've taken to complete the objective
        - Observations
        - Obstacles encountered
        - Links to starting and finishing commits
        - Reflection: was the objective achieved? Why or why not?
    4. Attributions
        - Have any classmates helped you?
        - Helpful/useful links and resources
            - Articles, videos, etc
            - Stack Overflow answers
            - Documentation references
        - What sites and content creators have you found most helpful?
    5. Research sessions
        - What questions do you want to answer?
        - What search terms are you using?

### Content breakdowns
Not sure if this fits under a coding journal? It definitely doesn't have to be a dated entry. Might be better off as an assignment or achievement (cleric badge?).

A breakdown is a summary/synopsis of a single article, video, podcast, etc:
- What are the key concepts?
- Useful quotes
- Sample code and snippets 
- Video chapter markers and timestamps
- Related and useful links
- Examples:
