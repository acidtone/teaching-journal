# Teaching Journal
A dedicated journal for teaching programming and learning teaching fundamentals in general.

## Inspiration
This journal was inspired by this video: [How learning journals can help students grow](breakdowns/how-learning-journals-can-help-students-grow.md).

## Purpose
This is a meta meta learning journal: I want to teach teachers how to teach programming. This journal was created for me to document my journey.

## Table of Contents
- `/index.md`: A reverse chronological list of daily notes/entries.
- `/breakdowns`: Summaries of individual articles, videos and resources.
