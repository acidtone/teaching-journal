## Three common theories for adult learning
1. Andragogy
    - Malcolm Knowles - Methods and principles of learning (1970s)
    - Adults are driven my internal motives. Adults:
        - are more willing to learn when learning has immediate value
            - "What's it's worth to me?"
        - use past experiences to connect learning
            - "I remember a time when..."
        - are independent learners
        - find relevance in task-oriented and problem-solving learning
2. Transformational Learning
    - Jack Mezirow - Adults learn when new meaning is related to a previous experience
    - Three stages of transformational learning
        1. Identification of a dilemma or crisis
        2. Establishment of personal relevance
        3. Provide opportunities for critical thinking 
3. Experiential Learning
    - David A. Kolb - Successfulness of learning is creating meaning from experiences.
    - Four stages of successful learning
        1. Concrete experience
        2. Reflective observation
        3. Abstract conceptualization
        4. Active experimentation
