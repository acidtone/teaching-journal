# [How learning journals can help students grow](https://bigthink.com/the-present/learning-journals/)
by Jiang Xueqin

## Summary
The purpose of a learning journal: 
- to give students the ability to self-assess accurately;
- to motivate students to learn;
- to promote meta-learning (learning to become a more effective learner).

## Three components to a learning journal
1. Define the learning goal concretely and precisely.
    - Example: running a marathon
        - **A good goal**: "I want to be able to run a marathon in less than 4 hours."
        - **NOT a good goal**: "I want to finish first in a marathon."
2. Write down the learning process.
3. Make observations, collect data, self-reflect and develop new learning strategies.

## Role of the teacher
> Teachers don't go away. Teachers become coaches.

### Three main functions of a Coach
1. Motivate the student.
2. Identify witnesses in the learning journal(?)
3. **Important**: Constantly suggest new learning strategies.
    - Example: A student wants to run a marathon.
        - "Have you thought about:
            - sleep patterns,
            - diet,
            - lifting weights,
            - running with friends?"
