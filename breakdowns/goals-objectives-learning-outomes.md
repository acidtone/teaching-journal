- Seems like a traditional behavourism-based summary of how to build a sylabus

![Summary of goals, objectives and learning outcomes](../assets/images/breakdowns/goals-objectives-outcomes.png)

- **Goals**: Larger aims of the course.
- **Objectives**: A map of the actions the instructor takes to achieve the Goals.
- **Outcomes**: What the learners actually produce as a result of the instruction Objectives.
    - Used to assess the student's learning so Outcomes must be measurable and observable.

- Goals, Objectives and Outcomes become progressively more concrete.

![Poor Action Verbs](../assets/images/breakdowns/poor-action-verbs.png)

- Wording matters
- Outcomes should describe the students will be able to do using:
    - Action verbs
    - the Content involved
    - the Context in which they will be using the Content
- These translate to the following in a learning outcome
    1. Action Word (performance)
    2. Learning Statement (the learning content)
    3. Criterion (condition)
- Bad action verbs: Learn, Know, Understand

![Better action verbs](../assets/images/breakdowns/better-action-verbs.png)

- Visualizing the action words should lead you to the action verbs that will produce a measurable, observable learning outcome.

![Blooms hierarchy of action verbs](../assets/images/breakdowns/blooms-hierarchy.png)

- Bloom's Hierarchy of learning organizes action verbs by the level of learning (beginner -> expert)
