## Summary
- Teacher workload is continually rising
- Teachers often don't have time to focus on the practice of teaching

## Four learning theories
1. Behaviourism
    - 1898: Edward Thorndike - Cat in a box
    - The teacher should be in control of the classroom
    - Repetition is the best way to learn
    - Based on operant conditioning
    - Skinner: applied behaviourism to teaching
        - learn through immediate feedback (he had a "teaching machine" that graded tests immediately)
    - Praise doesn't just encourage learning, it guides them by giving structure to their learning
    - Cons:
        - Theory does not take individual thinking into account and removes learner independence
        - By relying on observable behaviour, learning cannot be tailored to students needs
    - For the purpose of exams and student behaviour, Behaviourism still mostly works.
2. Liberationism
    - Is centred on the student instead of the teacher
    - 1964: Paulo Freire - "Emancipation through education"
        - found traditional school systems to be oppressive
    - Students should be treated as creators of knowledge
    - It expels the idea that education is about learning things and makes it more about the way we learn
        - If traditional ed was filling a cup, liberationism is like giving the cup arms so that it can fill itself.
    - Joe Lewis (Hall of Fame teacher): "Teachers should be a guide on the side rather than a sage on the stage"
    - By having cluster groups of students, the classroom can encapsulate more learning styles
3. Social Constructivism
    - Explores if students chatting in the classroom might be learning more
    - Assumes that social interaction is a key component to the learning experience
    - Lev Vygotsky
        - believed that children learn best when they talked between themselves to solve problems
    - Based on Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive constructivism
    - Social constructivism works best when time is set aside for students to discuss the topic with each other AND with the teacher
    - Example: teacher sets a problem that is to be solved in mixed ability groups
        - teaches the student the importance of communication and learning from others' experience
        - students that are further ahead benefit from solidifying information with their peers
        - students who are slightly behind will have a chance to catch up
4. Connectivism
    - Coined in 2005 by George Siemens
    - Considers the impact of technology in education and how teachers can adapt to it.
    - More than online learning; it teaches students to be learners in a digital age
