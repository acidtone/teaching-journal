## Assumptions
- teaching programming to children

## Summary
- Be a runner or a knitter
    - don't criticize choice of tool or language
    - be encouraging, regardless of skill level
- Mistakes can be great learning opportunities BUT
    - textbooks often focus on mistakes
        > "You will fail and it will be frustrating"
- Cognitive load
    - be sure to leave room for remembering and reflection
- Study: Minimal guidance does not work
- "You don't become an expert by doing expert things"0
    - If you're training for a marathon, you don't run a marathon every day
    - If you want children to become problem solvers, they first need to build the foundational problem solving "chunks" of skill that they can rely.
- Opinion: current educational frameworks focus on open exploration and inquiry but what would direct instruction for programming look like?
- Vocalizing (reading out loud) source code was pretty successful with children
    - found that there's no consistent model for how someone says "assign x equals 5"
    - findings: writing and reading code is not as effective as, EITHER
        - writing and reading code with an explanation (theory), OR
        - reading code with an explanation
            - note: writing code is often an outcome of most curriculums
- Assessments
    - only 23% of code clubs used any form of assessment
    - Goal: give the teacher an idea of what students understood from a lesson
        - exit tickets
            - simple and short multiple choice form
- Making programming like school isn't necessarily a bad thing
    - learning doesn't have to be fun to be motivating
    - building a skill can be motivating all on its own
